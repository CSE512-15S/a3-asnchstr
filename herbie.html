    <h1>Herbie Data Exploration</h1>
    <p>Ever wondered what the error of floating point
    programs <i>looks</i> like? The graph on the left shows you an
    overview of the error of the function sqrt(x+1) - sqrt(x), versus
    it's more accurate but mathematically equivilent version,
    1/(sqrt(x+1) + sqrt(x)). But lines of average aren't the best way
    to see how the error is distributed. The graph on the right shows
    what portion of the points have what error. Move around the
    selection on the left graph to see what the error distribution is
    at different points in the floating point spectrum.</p>
