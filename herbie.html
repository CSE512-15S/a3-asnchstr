    <h1>Herbie Data Exploration</h1>
    <p>Ever wondered what the error of floating point
      programs <i>looks</i> like? The graph on the left shows you an
      overview of the error of the quadtraic formula. The red line is
      the version you'll find in textbooks, and the green version is
      the version you can find in Richard Hammings "Numerical Methods
      for Scientists and Engineers". The one in blue is the version
      that our tool, Herbie, produces, when given the textbook version
      as input. But lines of average aren't the best way to see how
      the error is distributed. The graph on the right shows what
      portion of the points have what error. Move around the selection
      on the left graph to see what the error distribution is at
      different points in the floating point spectrum. The points are
      currently sorted based on the value of the input "a". Changing
      the axis dropdown changins which variable we sort the points
      on. Try setting it to "2" to see some interesting behavior.</p>
